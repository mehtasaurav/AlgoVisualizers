1) Download and extract the JavaFx archive file from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ according to OS compatibility.
2) Create a Environment variable and add the lib folder(folder that was extracted from javaFX) path to system variable path and give any name best of you choice as variable name.
3) Create a .java file and start writing Java/JavaFx code.
4) Save the file and open terminal on that same path.
5) At compile time and run time we need to specify the path to javafx lib as module path. Use the same system variable path to specify this.
6) We also need to the modules we will be using from that path.
7) For compile time : C:\Users\I589407\Documents\Anti-silos\microlysis>javac --module-path %JavaFxPath% --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml HelloFX.java
8) For run time : C:\Users\I589407\Documents\Anti-silos\microlysis>java --module-path %JavaFxPath% --add-modules javafx.controls HelloFX.java
