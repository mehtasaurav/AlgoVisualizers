# JavaFX Algorithm Visualizer

## Purpose  
The purpose of this project is **nothing specific**. I am creating it just to have hands-on experience with **JavaFX features**. I still have a lot to learn and explore.

## Features  
- Implements various **sorting algorithms** with visual representation.
- Uses **JavaFX** for UI and animations.
- Allows users to **input numbers** and see how sorting works dynamically.

## Technologies Used  
- Java  
- JavaFX  

## Future Plans  
- Improve the animation speed and controls.  
- Add more algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort.  
- Enhance UI with better visual effects.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehtasaurav/AlgoVisualizers.git
